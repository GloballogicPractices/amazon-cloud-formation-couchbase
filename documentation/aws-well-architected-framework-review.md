# AWS Well-Architected Framework Review
As part of the Couchbase partnership with AWS, we are working to ensure compliance with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf).  This document describes that effort.

# Security Pillar
## SEC 1. How are you protecting access to and use of the AWS root account credentials?
## SEC 2. How are you defining roles and responsibilities of system users to control human access to the AWS Management Console and API?
## SEC 3. How are you limiting automated access to AWS resources? (e.g., applications, scripts, and/or third-party tools or services)
## SEC 4. How are you capturing and analyzing logs?
## SEC 5. How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection?
## SEC 6. How are you leveraging AWS service level security features?
## SEC 7. How are you protecting the integrity of the operating systems on your Amazon EC2 instances?
## SEC 8. How are you classifying your data?
## SEC 9. How are you encrypting and protecting your data at rest?
## SEC 10. How are you managing keys?
## SEC 11. How are you encrypting and protecting your data in transit?
## SEC 12. How do you ensure you have the appropriate incident response?

# Reliability Pillar
## REL 1. How do you manage AWS service limits for your accounts?
## REL 2. How are you planning your network topology on AWS?
## REL 3. How does your system adapt to changes in demand?
## REL 4. How are you monitoring AWS resources?
## REL 5. How are you executing change?
## REL 6. How are you backing up your data?
## REL 7. How does your system withstand component failures?
## REL 8. How are you testing for resiliency?
## REL 9. How are you planning for disaster recovery?

# Performance Pillar
## PERF 1. How do you select the best performing architecture?
## PERF 2. How do you select your compute solution?
## PERF 3. How do you select your storage solution?
## PERF 4. How do you select your database solution?
## PERF 5. How do you select your network solution?
## PERF 6. How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate resource type as new resource types and features are introduced?
## PERF 7. How do you monitor your resources post-launch to ensure they are performing as expected?
## PERF 8. How do you use tradeoffs to improve performance?

# Cost Optimization Pillar
## COST 1. Are you considering cost when you select AWS services for your solution?
## COST 2. Have you sized your resources to meet your cost targets?
## COST 3. Have you selected the appropriate pricing model to meet your cost targets?
## COST 4. How do you make sure your capacity matches but does not substantially exceed what you need?
## COST 5. Did you consider data-transfer charges when designing your architecture?
## COST 6. How are you monitoring usage and spending?
## COST 7. Do you decommission resources that you no longer need or stop resources that are temporarily not needed?
## COST 8. What access controls and procedures do you have in place to govern AWS usage?
## COST 9. How do you manage and/or consider the adoption of new services?

# Operational Excellence Pillar
## OPS 1. What best practices for cloud operations are you using?
## OPS 2. How are you doing configuration management for your workload?
## OPS 3. How are you evolving your workload while minimizing the impact of change?
## OPS 4. How do you monitor your workload to ensure it is operating as expected?
## OPS 5. How do you respond to unplanned operational events?
## OPS 6. How is escalation managed when responding to unplanned operational events?
